# Course__PD-LGD-EAD-Modeling__Python
Modeling Probability of Default, Loss Given Default, and Exposure at Default

## Expected loss(EL) and its components: PD, LGD, and EAD
### Types of factors for expected loss
* Borrower Specific
* Economic Environment
  
### Established credit risk modeling defines expected loss as PD x LGD x EAD
* PD = Probability of Default
* LGD = Loss Given Default (Min Loss)
* EAD = Exposure at Default (Max Loss)
